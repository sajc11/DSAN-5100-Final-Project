# DSAN 5100 - Final
 

## **Project Overview**
This project investigates the relationship between public health metrics and housing risk scores in various districts. By analyzing vaccination rates, death rates, uninsured percentages, and housing-related factors, the study seeks to identify disparities and potential areas for policy intervention.

---

## **Research Question**

**What are the key factors contributing to high housing risk scores across districts, and how do public health and socioeconomic indicators correlate with these risks?**

---

## **Datasets**

The dataset used in this project includes housing risk scores and a variety of public health and socioeconomic metrics:

## **Key Findings**

### **1. Public Health Metrics and Risk Scores**

1. **Vaccination Rate vs. Risk Score**:
   - **Trend**: Negative correlation.
   - **Insight**: Higher vaccination rates correlate with lower housing risk scores, indicating better public health infrastructure.

2. **Death Rate vs. Risk Score**:
   - **Trend**: Positive correlation.
   - **Insight**: Districts with higher death rates tend to have higher risk scores, reflecting potential disparities in healthcare access.

3. **Uninsured Percent vs. Risk Score**:
   - **Trend**: Positive correlation.
   - **Insight**: Higher uninsured percentages are linked to increased housing risks, suggesting the importance of health insurance coverage.

### **2. Borough-Level Comparisons**

- The Bronx (BX) has the **highest average risk scores** and **death rates**.
- Manhattan (MN) leads in **vaccination rates** and has the **lowest death rates**.
- Queens (QN) has the **highest uninsured percent**.

## **Statistical Methods**

### **1. Hypothesis Testing**

1. **T-Test for Vaccination Rates**:
   - Districts with above-median vaccination rates have significantly lower risk scores compared to those below median rates.
   - **p-value**: 0.00017 (statistically significant).

2. **ANOVA for Uninsured Percent**:
   - Significant differences in risk scores exist among groups with low, medium, and high uninsured percentages.
   - **p-value**: 1.39eâˆ’05 (highly significant).

### **2. Correlation Analysis**

- Strong correlations exist between public health metrics like limited English proficiency and rent burden.
